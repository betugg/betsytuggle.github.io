                  <p>In spring of 2023, I was on the lookout for internship opportunities for the summer. I have always loved animation and had been teaching myself 2D animation ever since I was in the 9th grade, so when I saw the opportunity for an animation internship for the Childhood Cancer Society (CCS), I knew it was meant to be.</p>
                  <p>Interning for CCS was an incredibly rewarding experience from both a skill development standpoint and a moral standpoint. I was able to go through a full development cycle for an animated comic with a team of around 30 other artists and animators, creating numerous opportunities to receive feedback from industry professionals, but I also new that my work would be going towards a fantastic cause. Helping children and families going through such a difficult experience was truly fantastic. Even though the artists didn't interact with the children directly, we always were excited to see the happiness our hard work brought these children.</p> <p> In terms of what I did for CCS, I created 7 different animations for a multitude of projects across my 7 month internship. The video to the left depicts the different animations specifically as well as a link to the original post that is posted on CCS's YouTube. I made it a personal goal to one-up myself every single time I was assigned a new project. I went from a simple walk cycle in my audition video to a 360-degree camera shot and a 4-legged walk cycle. The shear amount of knowledge I learned from our weekly Show & Tell's was more than I could have ever hoped for.</p>
                  <p><span class="tab"></span>During this internship, I also found myself learning new areas of production that I hadn't previously delved to deeply into. For example, I was able to design costumes for the organization mascot, Adventure Ted, as well as design entirely new characters, such as Mayor Flowers. I even did some storyboards, creature design, and background art, all of which I was able to receive excellent feedback on from all the other artists and animators. Overall, my experience at CCS was amazing. I learned so much and met so many outstanding people. I wish them all the best in their future endeavors!</p>
