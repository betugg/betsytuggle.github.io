        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <p>I want to create like no one else.

          I've worked hard to learn different software in various mediums. I have tampered with Maya and Blender, and I have learned to code with Java and Python. I even learned to use Adobe Suite, but all of these programs have led me towards my main goal: 
          
          Animation.
          
          While I have dived deep into my academics to learn everything I can, I still grip on to the creative side of technology and how little bits of beauty can change someone's life. In my spare time, I have learned to draw, and I continue to learn because there is always a reason to obtain something new and better myself. This goal of mine is something I've dreamed of since I was little, yet it is so much different than anything I have done before. It takes time, persistence, and dedication to master something like drawing, and while I still have a long way to go, I will continue to push my limits and see my dreams become reality.
          
          This is my dream, and this is will be my story.</p>

          <h3>Birds at Work</h3>
          <p>I decided to create a complete animated short in one month.
            It was exhausting work, especially since it was my first time; however, working on this project led me to learn so many different software, applications, pre-production principles, and organization.</p>
