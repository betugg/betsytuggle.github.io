In summer of 2022, I wanted to prove to myself that I could make an animated short all by myself. No help. No background in editing. Just my experience and dedication to the craft of animation.


I started the journey by creating a series of storyboards. On a technical level, they were more like thumbnail sketches, but since I had given myself the deadline of completing this animated short in only one month, I decided that that was all I would need. After the thumbnail sketches and character designs were done, I immediately started animating, mistakenly ignoring the importance of an animatic. For the next month, I sat at my kitchen counter and used Adobe Animate to create a series of scenes and shots until I finally compiled them all using Adobe After Effects and Adobe Premiere.


In terms of what I learned from this project, I would say I learned an astronomical amount. My first mistake, as previously mentioned, was skipping the animatic stage. I noticed after I was done compiling the animations that the pacing was a bit off to me at a certain point, and that would have been noticed earlier if I had done an animatic. I also learned how to use Adobe After Effects to provide shading / lighting effects to my 2D animation. This expedited the process significantly, and I have been using this ever since. Finally, I realized that I needed a lot more experience in audio editing as I did not realize the level of difficulty and precision one must have to make designed audio blend into visuals.


Overall, I am incredibly grateful that I was motivated to complete this project successfully in one month as it gave me the confidence and motivation to continue with my animation work going forward.
